# Custom-cost-loadbalancer-SDN
It proposes a load balance solution scheme by taking advantage of the global network view of SDN. three load features are used from each transmission path. These features are bandwidth utilization ratio, link cost and transmission latency. By using these four load features, the custom cost load balancer predicts the integrated load for different path and to choose one with least load as the data-flow transmission path
